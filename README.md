## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while designing the database.

* [X] Normalization: Ensuring that the database design is fully normalized and adheres to the rules of normalization to minimize data redundancy, maintain data consistency, and improve data integrity.
* [X] Relationship mapping: Establishing proper relationships between tables, convert many-to-many to many-to-one relationships, to accurately reflect the data model and optimize query performance.
* [X] Testing database constraints and encryption: Testing Table-level Check Constraints based on a function, Computed Columns based on a function, and Column Data Encryption to ensure that the database is secure and complies with data privacy and ownership regulations.
